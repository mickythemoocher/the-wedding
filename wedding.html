<font color="#0000FF">Liz: </font color="#0000FF">It's a beautiful dress Kay<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF"> ( A little annoyed) I know it is a beautiful dress – just not on me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis:</font color="#0000FF"> You look gorgeous in it darling<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">But it doesn't fit! It did when  I bought it but it doesn't now<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">No it isn't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz:</font color="#0000FF"> It is Kay, honestly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">No it isn't – because I am not going<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">I don't care. I am not, not, not going.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis: </font color="#0000FF">You are, are, are. I am not going to have all those people laughing at me because the bride has changed her mind<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">What about them laughing at me? I will be walking down the aisle like a robot in a dress I can't move in.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis: </font color="#0000FF">Don't be so ridiculous. You will look nothing like a robot<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz:</font color="#0000FF"> Your mum's right Kay you won't look at all like a robot. More like you have your legs tied together<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Kay: </font color="#0000FF">Ahhh. You see mum?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis:</font color="#0000FF"> Please shut up Liz that didn't help at all.<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">I am taking it off and not going<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz:</font color="#0000FF"> What about Paul? You can't let him down on his wedding day. He will be devastated<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">Well he will just have to be devastated because I am not going.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Phylis: </font color="#0000FF">You really can't do that to him dear. Leave him standing at the alter like that<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF"> I'll message him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz: </font color="#0000FF">Message him????<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phyis:</font color="#0000FF"> You cannot possible send him a message<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz: </font color="#0000FF">No!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis: </font color="#0000FF">What are you going to say? Sorry I can't make it today something has turned up?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">Something like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis: </font color="#0000FF">I forbid it. Paul is a lovely man and you can't treat him like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz: </font color="#0000FF">You don't know how lucky you are Kay. Nobody wants to marry me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">That's because you are too choosy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz: </font color="#0000FF">No I'm not<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF">Yes you are. What about that man from The other side of town. You wouldn't marry him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Liz:</font color="#0000FF"> No, because he smelled of fish<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF"> Not his fault – he worked in a fish shop. See? You are choosy. Now help me get this dress off.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Phylis:</font color="#0000FF"> No! Definitely not – you are going<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> I have given it a good tug and it just won't meet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor:</font color="#0000FF"> I can't believe you Paul. How could you not have tried them on till today?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> I kept meaning too but just never got around to it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy: </font color="#0000FF">You must have put a lot of weight on Paul<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I suppose I have<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor:</font color="#0000FF"> You must have done if they fitted when you bought them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> What am I going to do? I can't go to my wedding like this.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy: </font color="#0000FF">You have to go mate. You can't let Kay down on her wedding day.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">But I can't go to the church like this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe you could wear a belt<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> I am wearing a belt<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">I can't see it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> No, because my belly is hanging over it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes you have definitely put on a bit weight Paul<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">Don't you have another suit you can wear Paul?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">Only the clown suit I wore at that fancy dress party<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">Well you can't wear that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">Why not? I'll look like a clown anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy:</font color="#0000FF"> I'd lend you one of mine but the wouldn't fit, I am a bit smaller than you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">And mine would look too big for you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe you cold hold something in front of you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> Like what? A crate of beer? That would look good in the church<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Andy: </font color="#0000FF">Only trying to help<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">There is only one  thing for it I will have to cancel, I can't go looking like this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">You can't cancel Paul. Kay would be devastated. You can't stand her up on her wedding day.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">I'll make her look a fool anyway if I turn up looking like this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy:</font color="#0000FF"> So what are you going to do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> I'll text her<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor:</font color="#0000FF"> Don't be stupid, you can't text your future wife on her wedding day to say you are not coming<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">Well what else can I do? There is no possible way I can go like this.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy:</font color="#0000FF"> Your dad is right mate. You can't send a text like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">Surely you have another pair of trousers that would fit. Would it really matter if it wasn't a suit?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">I am a car mechanic dad, all I have got is jeans<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy: </font color="#0000FF">No, you can't really go in jeans<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">I am sure Kay will understand why I can't be there<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor:</font color="#0000FF"> I have been married for 37 years and one thing I can tell you for certainty Paul is that she will not understand<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul;</font color="#0000FF"> Perhaps I could pretend to be injured<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor:</font color="#0000FF"> You will be injured if you don't turn up to that wedding. And not just by Kay<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy:</font color="#0000FF"> Very true, her mum and dad are going to be after you too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">Oh what a fix I am in. If I don't turn up everyone will hate me and if I do turn up everyone will hate because I look like a tramp.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy: </font color="#0000FF">On a scale from one to ten I think it may be better to turn up looking like a tramp<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, so do I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">No. I just can't do it. I'd never be able to face them again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Andy:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't really see you have any choice mate<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">No, nor do I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it has turned out so miserable<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Paul:</font color="#0000FF"> So firstly put this suit on<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Trevor: </font color="#0000FF">I wish you luck with that, she will go absolutely crazy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paul: </font color="#0000FF">Not if I explain it right. We will still be married, it's just that Andy will be the one going through the ceremony, with my name<p>
